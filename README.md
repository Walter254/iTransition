# iTransition Travel Companion 🌍✈️

A comprehensive mobile application designed to assist international students in their journey from pre-departure to settling in a new country. Built with React Native and Expo, iTransition aims to simplify the travel experience by providing essential tools and information tailored to each user's needs.

## 🎯 Project Overview

iTransition is envisioned as an all-in-one companion app for international students. It will simplify and personalize every aspect of the journey—from preparing necessary documents and booking travel to arranging local transportation and integrating with university systems for seamless onboarding.

### Key Goals:

- Provide a personalized user experience tailored to each student's background and study destination.
- Integrate with university systems to fetch real-time data such as academic calendars, orientation schedules, and campus maps.
- Support community building through social features, connecting new students with peers and alumni.
- Ensure critical functionalities are accessible offline.
- Plan for future expansion to cover employment, internships, cultural integration, and more.
